# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get started with this project, first 'npm i' to install all necessary modules then 'npm start' to run the app in Development mode.

It is recommended you login into an already existing account for the best experience with the following user account;

asukaleenverduijn@gmail.com
Josuka123!

But you can also create an account if you'd like to.

This app was made just for fun as a portfolio project. It is an CRUD based APP with an Auth feature using Firebase and ApLy for realtime notifications and mainly Firebase a backend plus realtime DB.
